# watchtower

WatchTower is a tool created to help detect both Rogue AP and Deauth attacks. It is in early stages of development and was developed initially to fulfill the requirements of my IT662 Data Communications and Networking class.

## config.json documentation
```json
{
  "ssid": "MyNetwork",
  "macs": [
    "51:34:98:97:46:B3"
  ],
  "channel": 6,
  "encryption": "WPA2",
  "cipher": "CCMP",
  "authentication": "PSK",
  "signalStrength": -35,
  "strengthVariance": 5,
  "checks": {
    "checkMAC": true,
    "checkChannel": false,
    "checkEncryption": true,
    "checkCipher": true,
    "checkAuthentication": true,
    "checkStrength": true
  },
  "slackWebhook": "",
  "sendSlackNotify": false
}
```
authType options:
* "WPA2"
* "WEP"
* "OPEN"

## Known issues
* In hostapd, if "wpa=" is set to 3 enabling both WPA and WPA2, we just detect it as WPA2
